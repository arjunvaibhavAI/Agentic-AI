# FinSight-Agent | AI-Powered Financial Insight Assistant
A business intelligence tool designed to provide real-time financial insights and market updates through a conversational interface.

## Business Problem
Business decision-makers, finance teams, and investors often rely on multiple platforms to track market trends, sector news, and financial updates. This results in:
- Time lost in manual research across different sources
- Delayed decision-making due to scattered information
- Increased dependency on analysts for basic data retrieval
- Lack of quick insights during client meetings or sales discussions in financial domains

## Solution Approach
To address these inefficiencies, I developed FinSight-Agent — an AI-powered assistant that:
- Consolidates financial news and market data from multiple sources
- Allows users to ask queries in plain English (e.g., “Latest news affecting the banking sector”)
- Provides instant, structured market updates to support decision-making
- Acts as a real-time intelligence layer that can be used in client discussions, sales consultations, or internal financial analysis

This project demonstrates how technology can be used to improve business intelligence workflows and enhance productivity for professionals engaged in financial sales, advisory, or client-facing roles.

## Technology Used
- Python & LangChain
- Streamlit (User Interface)
- Groq LLM (For fast real-time generation)
- Market & News APIs (Data Aggregation)
